Contributing can be broken up into 5 categories, and almost all tasks can be broken down into 30 minute chunks or smaller. There's a finite amount of work required to complete the corpus, and any time that you can spare is useful.

## Feedback

If you notice **anything** wrong in the Corpus, please [inform us](https://github.com/david-allison-1/manx-search-data/issues/new?assignees=&labels=content%2C+needs-triage&template=report-issue.md&title=) with a description of the item, and the content that is incorrect.

If you can [find the file](https://github.com/david-allison-1/manx-search-data/find/master) then feel free to make the change, and submit a Pull Request to fix the issue.

## Sourcing Documents

If any literature or audio transcriptions aren't yet available in the corpus, it may be because we're not aware that they exit. 

Please let us know by opening up a ["New Document" request](https://github.com/david-allison-1/manx-search-data/issues/new?assignees=&labels=add-document%2C+needs-triage&template=add-document.md&title=). Fill out the template to the best of your ability. If you only have a name, that's OK.

## Transcription

We have a large number of printed, written, and audio-based documents which need to be transcribed and timestamped. 

Please get in touch on the [discussions tab](https://github.com/david-allison-1/manx-search-data/discussions) and state that you want to help with transcription. We'll allocate you part of a document and instructions on how to proceed.

## Proofreading

Many of our texts on [Wikisource](https://wikisource.org/wiki/Main_Page/Gaelg) require proofreading. Create a Wikisource account and read https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Help:Beginner%27s_guide_to_proofreading

If you need any help, get in touch on the [discussions tab](https://github.com/david-allison-1/manx-search-data/discussions) and state that you want to help with transcription.
